# Influences of Cocaine and Sex Addiction on Reward Pathways

Humans often engage in behaviors that are rewarding and pleasurable. These pleasurable feelings are governed by the reward pathway, which consists of a group of neural structures that are accountable for self-stimulating behaviors. 

## Neural Structures in the Mesolimbic Pathway

{{< admonition type=note title="What is Mesolimbic Pathway?" open=true >}} The major dopamine pathway begins in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and connects the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic pathway is thought to be especially important to mediating pleasure and rewarding experiences. {{< /admonition >}}

Addiction is caused by the reinforcement of rewards and is executed by the mesolimbic system, which is comprised of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that releases dopaminergic neurons (dopamine) to the prefrontal cortex as well as the nucleus accumbems (NAc) in the ventral striatum, this is done through the limbic system. 

Reward-seeking behavior is typically associated with superior activations in the nucleus accumbems. The reward pathway is further driven by the release of dopamine into the nucleus accumbems, which is involved in reinforcing addictive behaviors. 

## Dopaminergic Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbems

The neurotransmitter, dopamine is released into the nucleus accumbens. When this occurs, it gives exposure to rewarding stimuli. Research suggests that these rewarding stimuli are experienced in recreational drugs like nicotine, morphine, cocaine, and substituted amphetamines.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its dopaminergic neurons are crutial for motivated behavior. Research implicates that dopamine receptors in the regulation of incentive motivation. Dompamine D1 and D2 receptors delivered to the nucleus accumbens decrease the willingness to work for rewards rather than affecting the hedonic value of the reward, it has been suggested that NAc dopamine promotes behavioral activation by regulating effort-related processes and overcoming work-related response costs. 

In line with these observations in animal models, abnormalities in striatal D2 receptor (D2R) levels have been consistently observed in human disorders with altered motivation including addiction, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Moreover, higher D2R binding in the left striatum relative to the right striatum has been associated with higher incentive motivation. 

### Nucleus Accumbens Dopamine in Sex and Concaine Addition

A study by Dalley and colleagues, suggests that cocaine addicts demonstrate Dopamine D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbems which determine cocaine self-administration and cocaine-seeking behavior. Almost similar effects were seen in sexual addiction for females, with an increase of Dopamine transmission to nucleus accumbems and striatum (Pfaus _et al.,_ 1995). This is further supported by Kohlert and Maisel, who found that males have increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbems during sexual activity followed by a rapid decline whereas, the dopamine in the nucleus accumbems. However, in females dopamine rises gradually and thereby is prolonged throughout sex. This suggests reward-seeking behavior (addiction) in both sexual addiction and cocaine addicts. 

Sex similar to drug usage, which creates long-term alterations like the nucleus accumbems sensitization. Repeated cocaine exposure and withdrawal leads to long-term changes, including behavioral and dopamine sensitization to an acute cocaine challenge, that are most pronounced after long withdrawal periods.

## Prefrontal Cortexes

Addiction is largely associated with the Prefrontal Cortex, through the mesocortical dopamine pathway. The prefrontal cortex is associated with forming connections with rewards. Additionally, other prefrontal areas including, Orbitofrontal Cortex and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) which are the pleasure centres in addiction, where orbitofrontal coretex and ACC play vital roles in addiction and are involved in anticipating rewards, cravings and mediate pleasure from rewards (Bush _et al._, 2002). 

Cocaine abusers show a decreased stimulation in ACC and the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex, most of which affect reward. (Bolla _et al.,_ 2004). Another study suggests that the grey matter concentration is decreased in the orbitofrontal cortex, ACC and superior temporal cortices (Franklin, 2002), implying that abstinent cocaine addicts experience difficulties in decision making, emotional valence and behavioural consciousness. 

Identical findings were found on the compulsive sexuality in paedophilia which reported decreased grey matter in ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, and cerebellum (Schiffer, 2007). This implies that both cocaine and paedophilia addicts experience similar reward stimulating and drug craving behaviours as well as impaired decision making.
