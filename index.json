[{"categories":[],"content":"When I first began quarantine, idle time turned my mind into slush. As an ambitious university student, I always found comfort in getting things done, task after task. However, the ongoing pandemic disrupted my plans, from the big ones I made months in advance to the smaller ones I used to make daily. Initially, I could not help but feel troubled; now, I realize that my greatest concern of finding something to do is a privilege. Nevertheless, the frustration I and many others feel with having idle time is important to mention because it stems from greater issues. Our society is obsessed with the idea of productivity, which discourages students like me from taking time to relax, deteriorates mental health, and restricts functioning. While the solution may seem as simple as setting aside more time for ourselves, the social pressures have taken the ability to make that decision out of people’s control. Ultimately, the notion that time should be used to create and succeed is ingrained in history. As such, systemic practices have long promoted the idea and further anchored it into American culture. For instance, employees in all sectors have workweeks of 40 hours or more indicating that the agencies normalize overworking as the standard. Moreover, the situation worsens across lines of class, race, and gender, with women more likely to take on multiple jobs, and people of color more likely to work in jobs that do not offer paid leave. Hence, the American work culture discourages downtime and prevents some people from having any at all. Additionally, this deep-rooted prioritization of productivity means that even when people are not at work or school, they are faced with the pressure to achieve and perform. Even during spare time, people feel pressured to curate their personal lives because social media turns them into a commodity. People spend more of their free time on their phones and for young people that means they are constantly engaging on social media. This is concerning since companies design social media applications to be addictive and mindless. However, excessive time on social media is associated with increased levels of anxiety. As a result, even though engaging with social media feels as simple as idle scrolling, it is not quite relaxing. Instead, by participating in social media, people fall into the trap of presenting their personal lives as exciting as possible and comparing themselves with the best depictions of their peers. Therefore, much of people’s idle time ends up pushing them to meet expectations. Unfortunately, people have less true downtime, which has severe consequences for well-being, personal growth, and contentment. The pressure for productivity and increased use of social media encourage perfectionism. Furthermore, without downtime, individuals miss out on boredom. While that may not seem detrimental, boredom often serves as an opportunity for people to check in with themselves and assess how they spend their time and efforts. By doing so, individuals become more mindful in their life, feel comfortable in managing negative thoughts and emotions, and gain the focus required to resume work more efficiently. In addition, it is necessary to spend time away from sources of stress and external pressures to pause the blurring of days and experiences that comes from constant productivity. Eventually, this separation is helpful since it allows people to fuel their creativity, connect with themselves, and as counterintuitive as it may seem, be more productive. Subsequently, because downtime is necessary for well-being and productivity, it is essential for societal and economic functioning. Therefore, industries need to acknowledge that the mental health of their employees is an asset to their productivity and ensure that their employees have time to unwind. Likewise, social media businesses need to learn that because their users’ mental health and ability to be consumers are interconnected, it is in their best ","date":"2020-03-06","objectID":"/theme-documentation-basics/:0:0","series":[],"tags":[],"title":"The Obsession over Productivity","uri":"/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":[],"content":"Humans often engage in behaviors that are rewarding and pleasurable.

The major dopamine pathway begins in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and connects the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic pathway is thought to be especially important to mediating pleasure and rewarding experiences. Addiction is caused by the reinforcement of rewards and is executed by the mesolimbic system, which is comprised of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that releases dopaminergic neurons (dopamine) to the prefrontal cortex as well as the nucleus accumbems (NAc) in the ventral striatum, this is done through the limbic system. Reward-seeking behavior is typically associated with superior activations in the nucleus accumbems. The reward pathway is further driven by the release of dopamine into the nucleus accumbems, which is involved in reinforcing addictive behaviors.

When this occurs, it gives exposure to rewarding stimuli. Research suggests that these rewarding stimuli are experienced in recreational drugs like nicotine, morphine, cocaine, and substituted amphetamines. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its dopaminergic neurons are crutial for motivated behavior. Research implicates that dopamine receptors in the regulation of incentive motivation. Dompamine D1 and D2 receptors delivered to the nucleus accumbens decrease the willingness to work for rewards rather than affecting the hedonic value of the reward, it has been suggested that NAc dopamine promotes behavioral activation by regulating effort-related processes and overcoming work-related response costs. In line with these observations in animal models, abnormalities in striatal D2 receptor (D2R) levels have been consistently observed in human disorders with altered motivation including addiction, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Moreover, higher D2R binding in the left striatum relative to the right striatum has been associated with higher incentive motivation.

Almost similar effects were seen in sexual addiction for females, with an increase of Dopamine transmission to nucleus accumbems and striatum (Pfaus et al., 1995). This is further supported by Kohlert and Maisel, who found that males have increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbems during sexual activity followed by a rapid decline whereas, the dopamine in the nucleus accumbems. However, in females dopamine rises gradually and thereby is prolonged throughout sex. This suggests reward-seeking behavior (addiction) in both sexual addiction and cocaine addicts. Sex similar to drug usage, which creates long-term alterations like the nucleus accumbems sensitization. Repeated cocaine exposure and withdrawal leads to long-term changes, including behavioral and dopamine sensitization to an acute cocaine challenge, that are most pronounced after long withdrawal periods.

Cocaine abusers show a decreased stimulation in ACC and the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex, most of which affect reward. (Bolla et al., 2004). Another study suggests that the grey matter concentration is decreased in the orbitofrontal cortex, ACC and superior temporal cortices (Franklin, 2002), implying that abstinent cocaine addicts experience difficulties in decision making, emotional valence and behavioural consciousness. Identical findings were found on the compulsive sexuality in paedophilia which reported decreased grey matter in ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, and cerebellum (Schiffer, 2007). This implies that both cocaine and paedophilia addicts experience similar reward stimulating and drug craving behaviours as well as impaired decision making.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Well, the straight answer to this questions is: “You don’t need to turn your site into a PWA.” A normal website is good enough for all the content you want to share. However, a PWA brings some extra benefits that might be useful. Pages will be automatically cached by service workers when the app is installed, which enables a near-instantaneous loading from the second visit. Users can always visit cached pages when they are offline. These features may be useful for some websites, such as this documentation site. But it does not make much sense to turn a personal blog into a PWA. In the end, it all depends on your choice, and the DoIt theme will provide this feature for you anyway.

Along with this, I also love other fields within psychology such as Social Psychology, Biopsychology, and Forensic Psychology, thereby you will see a lot of posts pertaining to these topics. Space Psychology As a nature lover and a psychology student, I also have a minor obsession in Space Psychology, which is the application of psychology within spaceflight. I understand this may be a niche field within I/O Psychology and Human Factors and isn’t widely researched, but I think it would be interesting to address the issues faced by astronauts and how loneliness, reduced material comforts and so much more can impact the mental wellbeing. Thereby, I hope to keep this a short fun series.

We have a wide range of series- some of which involve the forensic psychology series and the neuropsychology series. I mainly host the Clinical and Applied Psychology series in a Case Studies format. One of my favourite episodes One of my favourite episodes was debunking the case of a middle-aged German woman, B.T. who was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Though she was blind, some of her alter-personalities were capable of sight and could see whilst others suffered from vision loss. This was just one of those episodes that had a beautiful blend of Clinical Psychology and Biopsychology.
