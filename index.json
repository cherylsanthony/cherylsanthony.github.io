[{"categories":["Productivity"],"content":"When I first began quarantine, idle time turned my mind into slush. As an ambitious university student, I always found comfort in getting things done, task after task. However, the ongoing pandemic disrupted my plans, from the big ones I made months in advance to the smaller ones I used to make daily. Initially, I could not help but feel troubled; now, I realize that my greatest concern of finding something to do is a privilege. Nevertheless, the frustration I and many others feel with having idle time is important to mention because it stems from greater issues. Our society is obsessed with the idea of productivity, which discourages students like me from taking time to relax, deteriorates mental health, and restricts functioning. While the solution may seem as simple as setting aside more time for ourselves, the social pressures have taken the ability to make that decision out of people’s control. Ultimately, the notion that time should be used to create and succeed is ingrained in history. As such, systemic practices have long promoted the idea and further anchored it into American culture. For instance, employees in all sectors have workweeks of 40 hours or more indicating that the agencies normalize overworking as the standard. Moreover, the situation worsens across lines of class, race, and gender, with women more likely to take on multiple jobs, and people of color more likely to work in jobs that do not offer paid leave. Hence, the American work culture discourages downtime and prevents some people from having any at all. Additionally, this deep-rooted prioritization of productivity means that even when people are not at work or school, they are faced with the pressure to achieve and perform. Even during spare time, people feel pressured to curate their personal lives because social media turns them into a commodity. People spend more of their free time on their phones and for young people that means they are constantly engaging on social media. This is concerning since companies design social media applications to be addictive and mindless. However, excessive time on social media is associated with increased levels of anxiety. As a result, even though engaging with social media feels as simple as idle scrolling, it is not quite relaxing. Instead, by participating in social media, people fall into the trap of presenting their personal lives as exciting as possible and comparing themselves with the best depictions of their peers. Therefore, much of people’s idle time ends up pushing them to meet expectations. Unfortunately, people have less true downtime, which has severe consequences for well-being, personal growth, and contentment. The pressure for productivity and increased use of social media encourage perfectionism. Furthermore, without downtime, individuals miss out on boredom. While that may not seem detrimental, boredom often serves as an opportunity for people to check in with themselves and assess how they spend their time and efforts. By doing so, individuals become more mindful in their life, feel comfortable in managing negative thoughts and emotions, and gain the focus required to resume work more efficiently. In addition, it is necessary to spend time away from sources of stress and external pressures to pause the blurring of days and experiences that comes from constant productivity. Eventually, this separation is helpful since it allows people to fuel their creativity, connect with themselves, and as counterintuitive as it may seem, be more productive. Subsequently, because downtime is necessary for well-being and productivity, it is essential for societal and economic functioning. Therefore, industries need to acknowledge that the mental health of their employees is an asset to their productivity and ensure that their employees have time to unwind. Likewise, social media businesses need to learn that because their users’ mental health and ability to be consumers are interconnected, it is in their best ","date":"2021-09-18","objectID":"/theme-documentation-basics/:0:0","series":["Productivity"],"tags":[],"title":"The Obsession over Productivity","uri":"/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["Psychobiology"],"content":"Humans often engage in behaviors that are rewarding and pleasurable.

The major dopamine pathway begins in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and connects the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic pathway is thought to be especially important to mediating pleasure and rewarding experiences. Addiction is caused by the reinforcement of rewards and is executed by the mesolimbic system, which is comprised of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that releases dopaminergic neurons (dopamine) to the prefrontal cortex as well as the nucleus accumbems (NAc) in the ventral striatum, this is done through the limbic system. Reward-seeking behavior is typically associated with superior activations in the nucleus accumbems. The reward pathway is further driven by the release of dopamine into the nucleus accumbems, which is involved in reinforcing addictive behaviors.

When this occurs, it gives exposure to rewarding stimuli. Research suggests that these rewarding stimuli are experienced in recreational drugs like nicotine, morphine, cocaine, and substituted amphetamines. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its dopaminergic neurons are crutial for motivated behavior. Research implicates that dopamine receptors in the regulation of incentive motivation. Dompamine D1 and D2 receptors delivered to the nucleus accumbens decrease the willingness to work for rewards rather than affecting the hedonic value of the reward, it has been suggested that NAc dopamine promotes behavioral activation by regulating effort-related processes and overcoming work-related response costs. In line with these observations in animal models, abnormalities in striatal D2 receptor (D2R) levels have been consistently observed in human disorders with altered motivation including addiction, schizophrenia, and ADHD. Moreover, higher D2R binding in the left striatum relative to the right striatum has been associated with higher incentive motivation.

This is further supported by Kohlert and Maisel, who found that males have increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbems during sexual activity followed by a rapid decline whereas, the dopamine in the nucleus accumbems. However, in females dopamine rises gradually and thereby is prolonged throughout sex. This suggests reward-seeking behavior (addiction) in both sexual addiction and cocaine addicts.

Identical findings were found on the compulsive sexuality in paedophilia which reported decreased grey matter in ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, and cerebellum (Schiffer, 2007).

I would also probably be reminded of some opinions I no longer believe and if you’re being honest with yourself, yours likely would be equally cringe. The things we have said in the past may not have been outrageously offensive, but we have all made comments, or held opinions, we later regret. We are, after all, inherently flawed creatures, but imagine if a single lapse in judgment stayed with you for the rest of your life. This is the issue that our society is currently dealing with as a result of the predominance of cancel culture. “Mess with the bull, and you’ll get the horn.\" These words perfectly apply to the cancel-culture of today. As we all know, cancel culture refers to when someone (typically a celebrity) gets “removed” as a nice person or public figure on social media after saying or doing something that others find disrespectful. This leads to mass-hatred and bullying. The idea is that if you do something that others deem problematic, you automatically lose all your currency. Your voice is silenced, and you’re done. But why do people love cancel culture if it provokes so much hated towards one person? Cancel culture exists because social identities exist. We follow brands and celebrities, in part, as a form of self-expression and at an extreme, we also “cancel” them as a form of self-expression. Our sense of identity is rooted in our core values and beliefs. According to social identity theory our sense of identity is shaped by the social groups we belong to. In the digital world, social identities are at our fingertips. Social media has made it easier for people to represent their social identity via skin color-specific emojis, flags of countries they’ve traveled to zodiac signs, and much more. We express ourselves by following those who embody our identity. This is our identity expression. If you are a person who loves the outdoors, going to the gym, and eating healthy, you are more likely to follow those who enjoy the same things. If you are proud of your city, you tend to support those who resonate with your sense of identity. Similarly, if you believe Beyoncé represents feminism and you identify with her fight for women’s empowerment, there’s a chance you’d like and approve of her as queen status. When we follow someone who shares our values, we are expressing our identity by aligning ourselves with them. In the social media realm, this means publicly liking and resharing their content. By doing this, we’re stating to the world, “This is me, I’m the kind of person who likes Beyoncé and values female empowerment.\" Everything and everyone you share, post about, or like can be a way of signaling your social identity. This is all well and good when the celebrities and brands you align yourself with also share your values. But what happens when they suddenly don’t? What happens, for example, when this celebrity we love now does something which violates our values? Cognitive dissonance theory stipulates that we have an innate human drive for consistency. We can’t go about our merry business with this incompatibility in mind. Instead, we MUST resolve this dissonance and we can go about this in one of two ways: either by sticking with the celebrity and changing our values or by sticking with our values and changing our allegiance with the individual and the option we typically choose is the latter. This decision is what drives cancel culture. Values are notoriously difficult to change. Unless you’re obsessively attached to the individual, chances are you’ll ditch them for your values. Moreover, changing your affiliation allows for the all-important additional incentive of identity expression. We don’t just dismiss them in private. Instead, by urging their ‘cancellation,’ we declare the dismissal to the world.

For example, Eysenck in his theory of arousal in introversion – extraversion (Eysenck, 1981) suggests that extraverts are sociable and friendly because they seek arousing conditions that stimulates their sensory levels. Eysenck further states that extraverts are more likely to seek out arousal (or seek to stimulate their sensory levels) because extraverts have are not sensory sensitive. On the other hand, introverts innately have an increased sensory sensitivity and thereby, may not seek stimulating environments that increase their arousal.

A study by Larsen and Rusting (1997), discovered that extraverts rated social situations more positively than introverts when the environmental condition was pleasant. Furthermore, extraverts also tended to experience positive affect for a much longer duration when compared to introverts (Derryberry \u0026 Reed, 1994), due to this, extraverts are more likely to seek out social conditions than introverts (Pavot et al., 1990) because extraverts may experience more increased arousal in a social situation than in a non-social situation. All points considered, this suggests that extraverts are more likely to experience happiness. However, the evidence for the social activity hypothesis is statistically weak which may be due to gregariousness (one of the 21 measures of extraversion) is not correlated to positive affect (Hills \u0026 Argyle, 2001). Conversely, there is more support that introverts and extraverts have found to have equal positive affect in social conditions (Clark \u0026 Watson, 1988). This is further supported by Pavot, Diener, and Fujita (1990) who proposed that sociability is linked to positive affect for both extraverts as well as introverts. Therefore, it can be suggested that social conditions are not a mediator between extraversion and happiness.

In the western world, closeness and positive affect are common social desires, due to this extraversion as a relation to both closeness and positive affect is seen as a socially desirable personality trait. Contrary to this however, television in the western world often symbolises happiness to be derived from isolated activities. Livingstone (1988) has indicated that frequent viewers of television may form pleasing and enjoyable fictional relationships with the characters appearing on screen. An additional prospect may be societal (Diener, Larsen \u0026 Emmons, 1984). Modern-day life is extremely interactive and has developed to be progressively essential to rely on others for survival. Moreover, working conditions have changed to a more team effort and sociable environment. Thereby, individuals that account for greater levels of well-being are possibly well adjusted to a sociable lifestyle and may also be those that may find making close relations simple. Argyle and Lu (1990) have also suggested that social competence may be a partial mediation for the relation between extraversion and happiness.

A highly sensitive behavioural activation system during social situations, implies that, extraverts have stronger reinforcing effects from the mesolimbic dopamine system. Thereby, extraverts may not only have an increased reward sensitivity which may in turn lead to higher amounts of positive affect but, extraverts may also tend to seek high rewarding conditions more often than introverts due to heightened sensitivity of the behavioural activation system in extraverts. This aligns with the Social Attention Theory (Ashton, Lee, \u0026 Paunonen, 2002) which also found a significant association between extraversion and happiness. They proposed that extraversion tends to behave in ways that attract social attention and claim that extraverts may find the qualities of social attention potentially rewarding. Thereby, when an individual showcases positive effect such as passion, interest, and exhilaration, the extravert views themselves favourably by others. This positive response from others leads to an increased self-esteem and urges extraverts to participate in more extraverted behaviour.

In other words, most studies measure the degree of happiness using activities like socializing, in which extraverts thrive in. However, happiness is subjective. Introverts find more happiness in their inner-worlds while extroverts find happiness through their external worlds. While interaction with others is a huge factor in our happiness, for some it’s quality not quantity that decides how we feel in our relationships with others. But considering happiness is not all based on relationships and how often we interact, does this mean introverts are just as happy as extroverts? Eastern culture has introduced mindfulness, calm, meditation and quiet as an important way to connect with ourselves and reach inner happiness – things that introverts do naturally by spending more time alone. Despite whether one is better than the other, what a lot of studies agree on is that the key to happiness is down to accepting ourselves, finding purpose, and creating a good social circle and what can definitely be concluded is that this can be achieved by anyone whether you’re an extrovert or an introvert.

Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

Well, the straight answer to this questions is: “You don’t need to turn your site into a PWA.” A normal website is good enough for all the content you want to share. However, a PWA brings some extra benefits that might be useful. Pages will be automatically cached by service workers when the app is installed, which enables a near-instantaneous loading from the second visit. Users can always visit cached pages when they are offline. These features may be useful for some websites, such as this documentation site. But it does not make much sense to turn a personal blog into a PWA. In the end, it all depends on your choice, and the DoIt theme will provide this feature for you anyway.

Along with this, I also love other fields within psychology such as Social Psychology, Biopsychology, and Forensic Psychology, thereby you will see a lot of posts pertaining to these topics. Space Psychology As a nature lover and a psychology student, I also have a minor obsession in Space Psychology, which is the application of psychology within spaceflight. I understand this may be a niche field within I/O Psychology and Human Factors and isn’t widely researched, but I think it would be interesting to address the issues faced by astronauts and how loneliness, reduced material comforts and so much more can impact the mental wellbeing. Thereby, I hope to keep this a short fun series.

We have a wide range of series- some of which involve the forensic psychology series and the neuropsychology series. I mainly host the Clinical and Applied Psychology series in a Case Studies format. One of my favourite episodes One of my favourite episodes was debunking the case of a middle-aged German woman, B.T. who was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Though she was blind, some of her alter-personalities were capable of sight and could see whilst others suffered from vision loss. This was just one of those episodes that had a beautiful blend of Clinical Psychology and Biopsychology.
