            </div><div class="content" id="content"><p>Extraversion is a personality trait often described as sociable. For example, Eysenck in his theory of arousal in introversion – extraversion (Eysenck, 1981) suggests that extraverts are sociable and friendly because they seek arousing conditions that stimulates their sensory levels. Eysenck further states that extraverts are more likely to seek out arousal (or seek to stimulate their sensory levels) because extraverts have are not sensory sensitive. On the other hand, introverts innately have an increased sensory sensitivity and thereby, may not seek stimulating environments that increase their arousal.</p>
<h3 id="social-condition-as-a-mediator-between-extraverts-and-happiness">Social Condition as a mediator between Extraverts and Happiness</h3>
<p>Several researchers believe in the social activity hypothesis (Lucas et al., 2008; Pavot, Diener &amp; Fujita, 1990; Watson, et al., 1992) The social acitivity hypothesis suggests that human beings as social creatures may experience increased happiness in communicating. A study by Larsen and Rusting (1997), discovered that extraverts rated social situations more positively than introverts when the environmental condition was pleasant. Furthermore, extraverts also tended to experience positive affect for a much longer duration when compared to introverts (Derryberry &amp; Reed, 1994), due to this, extraverts are more likely to seek out social conditions than introverts (Pavot et al., 1990) because extraverts may experience more increased arousal in a social situation than in a non-social situation. All points considered, this suggests that extraverts are more likely to experience happiness.</p>
<p>However, the evidence for the social activity hypothesis is statistically weak which may be due to gregariousness (one of the 21 measures of extraversion) is not correlated to positive affect (Hills &amp; Argyle, 2001). Conversely, there is more support that introverts and extraverts have found to have equal positive affect in social conditions (Clark &amp; Watson, 1988). This is further supported by Pavot, Diener, and Fujita (1990) who proposed that sociability is linked to positive affect for both extraverts as well as introverts. Therefore, it can be suggested that social conditions are not a mediator between extraversion and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="culture-playing-a-role-of-idealised-self-in-social-situations">Culture playing a role of idealised self in social situations</h3>
<p>Culture may also play a strong role in mediating the relation between extraversion and happiness. In the western world, closeness and positive affect are common social desires, due to this extraversion as a relation to both closeness and positive affect is seen as a socially desirable personality trait. Contrary to this however, television in the western world often symbolises happiness to be derived from isolated activities. Livingstone (1988) has indicated that frequent viewers of television may form pleasing and enjoyable fictional relationships with the characters appearing on screen. An additional prospect may be societal (Diener, Larsen &amp; Emmons, 1984). Modern-day life is extremely interactive and has developed to be progressively essential to rely on others for survival. Moreover, working conditions have changed to a more team effort and sociable environment. Thereby, individuals that account for greater levels of well-being are possibly well adjusted to a sociable lifestyle and may also be those that may find making close relations simple. Argyle and Lu (1990) have also suggested that social competence may be a partial mediation for the relation between extraversion and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="extraverts-being-more-reward-sensitive-in-social-situations">Extraverts being more reward sensitive in social situations</h3>
<p>According to reinforcement sensitive theory (Gray, 1982) extraverts experience increased amounts of positive in social situations due to heightened reward sensitivity. A highly sensitive behavioural activation system during social situations, implies that, extraverts have stronger reinforcing effects from the mesolimbic dopamine system. Thereby, extraverts may not only have an increased reward sensitivity which may in turn lead to higher amounts of positive affect but, extraverts may also tend to seek high rewarding conditions more often than introverts due to heightened sensitivity of the behavioural activation system in extraverts.</p>
<p>This aligns with the Social Attention Theory (Ashton, Lee, &amp; Paunonen, 2002) which also found a significant association between extraversion and happiness. They proposed that extraversion tends to behave in ways that attract social attention and claim that extraverts may find the qualities of social attention potentially rewarding. Thereby, when an individual showcases positive effect such as passion, interest, and exhilaration, the extravert views themselves favourably by others. This positive response from others leads to an increased self-esteem and urges extraverts to participate in more extraverted behaviour.</p>
<h3 id="non-realiable-and-invalid-measurement-of-happiness">Non-realiable and invalid measurement of happiness</h3>
<p>While these studies are interesting and worthwhile, there is, what could be considered, a flaw in how people’s personalities are measured. Most psychologists use the NEO PI-R assessment when conducting happiness and personality studies which only focus on the presence or absence of extroverted qualities. In other words, there is no emphasis on positively valuing introverted qualities.</p>
<p>If you are an introvert yourself you can identify with the happiness you feel sitting by yourself with a good book and perhaps socialising less than extroverts, yet these are considered qualities associated with unhappiness.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All points considered, despite various research that have found a strong positive correlation between extraversion as a personality trait and happiness, most research is directed towards social activity being a robust mediator of extraversion and positive affect. In other words, most studies measure the degree of happiness using activities like socializing, in which extraverts thrive in. However, happiness is subjective. Introverts find more happiness in their inner-worlds while extroverts find happiness through their external worlds.</p>
<p>While interaction with others is a huge factor in our happiness, for some it’s quality not quantity that decides how we feel in our relationships with others. But considering happiness is not all based on relationships and how often we interact, does this mean introverts are just as happy as extroverts? Eastern culture has introduced mindfulness, calm, meditation and quiet as an important way to connect with ourselves and reach inner happiness – things that introverts do naturally by spending more time alone.</p>
<p>Despite whether one is better than the other, what a lot of studies agree on is that the key to happiness is down to accepting ourselves, finding purpose, and creating a good social circle and what can definitely be concluded is that this can be achieved by anyone whether you’re an extrovert or an introvert.</p>
