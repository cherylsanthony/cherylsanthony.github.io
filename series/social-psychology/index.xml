            </div>If there was a film that recorded every moment of my life, you can guarantee that it would include some pretty foolish statements I’ve made throughout the years. I would also probably be reminded of some opinions I no longer believe and if you’re being honest with yourself, yours likely would be equally cringe. The things we have said in the past may not have been outrageously offensive, but we have all made comments, or held opinions, we later regret.]]></description>

            </div>Extraversion is a personality trait often described as sociable. For example, Eysenck in his theory of arousal in introversion – extraversion (Eysenck, 1981) suggests that extraverts are sociable and friendly because they seek arousing conditions that stimulates their sensory levels. Eysenck further states that extraverts are more likely to seek out arousal (or seek to stimulate their sensory levels) because extraverts have are not sensory sensitive. On the other hand, introverts innately have an increased sensory sensitivity and thereby, may not seek stimulating environments that increase their arousal.]]></description>
