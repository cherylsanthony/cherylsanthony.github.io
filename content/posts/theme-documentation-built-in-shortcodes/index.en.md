If there was a film that recorded every moment of my life, you can guarantee that it would include some pretty foolish statements I’ve made throughout the years. I would also probably be reminded of some opinions I no longer believe and if you’re being honest with yourself, yours likely would be equally cringe. The things we have said in the past may not have been outrageously offensive, but we have all made comments, or held opinions, we later regret. We are, after all, inherently flawed creatures, but imagine if a single lapse in judgment stayed with you for the rest of your life. This is the issue that our society is currently dealing with as a result of the predominance of cancel culture.

“Mess with the bull, and you'll get the horn." These words perfectly apply to the cancel-culture of today. As we all know, cancel culture refers to when someone (typically a celebrity) gets "removed" as a nice person or public figure on social media after saying or doing something that others find disrespectful. This leads to mass-hatred and bullying. The idea is that if you do something that others deem problematic, you automatically lose all your currency. Your voice is silenced, and you’re done. But why do people love cancel culture if it provokes so much hated towards one person?

Cancel culture exists because social identities exist. We follow brands and celebrities, in part, as a form of self-expression and at an extreme, we also "cancel" them as a form of self-expression. Our sense of identity is rooted in our core values and beliefs. According to social identity theory our sense of identity is shaped by the social groups we belong to. In the digital world, social identities are at our fingertips. Social media has made it easier for people to represent their social identity via skin color-specific emojis, flags of countries they've traveled to zodiac signs, and much more. We express ourselves by following those who embody our identity. This is our identity expression. If you are a person who loves the outdoors, going to the gym, and eating healthy, you are more likely to follow those who enjoy the same things. If you are proud of your city, you tend to support those who resonate with your sense of identity. Similarly, if you believe Beyoncé represents feminism and you identify with her fight for women's empowerment, there's a chance you'd like and approve of her as queen status. When we follow someone who shares our values, we are expressing our identity by aligning ourselves with them. In the social media realm, this means publicly liking and resharing their content. By doing this, we're stating to the world, “This is me, I'm the kind of person who likes Beyoncé and values female empowerment." Everything and everyone you share, post about, or like can be a way of signaling your social identity. This is all well and good when the celebrities and brands you align yourself with also share your values. But what happens when they suddenly don't? What happens, for example, when this celebrity we love now does something which violates our values?

Cognitive dissonance theory stipulates that we have an innate human drive for consistency. We can't go about our merry business with this incompatibility in mind. Instead, we MUST resolve this dissonance and we can go about this in one of two ways: either by sticking with the celebrity and changing our values or by sticking with our values and changing our allegiance with the individual and the option we typically choose is the latter. This decision is what drives cancel culture. Values are notoriously difficult to change. Unless you're obsessively attached to the individual, chances are you'll ditch them for your values. Moreover, changing your affiliation allows for the all-important additional incentive of identity expression. We don't just dismiss them in private. Instead, by urging their 'cancellation,' we declare the dismissal to the world.

Our innate drive towards consistency and away from dissonance makes it difficult to live in the gray area. It is fueling cancel culture, but it is also pushing brands who sell us on an identity to be more consistent. Social identities are reliable drivers of behavior, especially when dissonance is at play. Cognitive dissonance forces our brains to choose one of two ways outlined earlier: stick to the brand/celebrity and change your values or cancel the brand/celebrity and stick to your values. Whichever way you go, one thing is clear. Don't mess with cancel culture or you'll get the horns.
