subtitle: The frustration over having too much downtime

---
When I first began quarantine, idle time turned my mind into slush. As an ambitious university student, I always found comfort in getting things done, task after task. However, the ongoing pandemic disrupted my plans, from the big ones I made months in advance to the smaller ones I used to make daily. Initially, I could not help but feel troubled; now, I realize that my greatest concern of finding something to do is a privilege. Nevertheless, the frustration I and many others feel with having idle time is important to mention because it stems from greater issues. Our society is obsessed with the idea of productivity, which discourages students like me from taking time to relax, deteriorates mental health, and restricts functioning.

While the solution may seem as simple as setting aside more time for ourselves, the social pressures have taken the ability to make that decision out of people’s control. Ultimately, the notion that time should be used to create and succeed is ingrained in history. As such, systemic practices have long promoted the idea and further anchored it into American culture. For instance, employees in all sectors have workweeks of 40 hours or more indicating that the agencies normalize overworking as the standard. Moreover, the situation worsens across lines of class, race, and gender, with women more likely to take on multiple jobs, and people of color more likely to work in jobs that do not offer paid leave. Hence, the American work culture discourages downtime and prevents some people from having any at all.

Additionally, this deep-rooted prioritization of productivity means that even when people are not at work or school, they are faced with the pressure to achieve and perform. Even during spare time, people feel pressured to curate their personal lives because social media turns them into a commodity. People spend more of their free time on their phones and for young people that means they are constantly engaging on social media. This is concerning since companies design social media applications to be addictive and mindless. However, excessive time on social media is associated with increased levels of anxiety. As a result, even though engaging with social media feels as simple as idle scrolling, it is not quite relaxing. Instead, by participating in social media, people fall into the trap of presenting their personal lives as exciting as possible and comparing themselves with the best depictions of their peers. Therefore, much of people’s idle time ends up pushing them to meet expectations.

Unfortunately, people have less true downtime, which has severe consequences for well-being, personal growth, and contentment. The pressure for productivity and increased use of social media encourage perfectionism. Furthermore, without downtime, individuals miss out on boredom. While that may not seem detrimental, boredom often serves as an opportunity for people to check in with themselves and assess how they spend their time and efforts. By doing so, individuals become more mindful in their life, feel comfortable in managing negative thoughts and emotions, and gain the focus required to resume work more efficiently. In addition, it is necessary to spend time away from sources of stress and external pressures to pause the blurring of days and experiences that comes from constant productivity. Eventually, this separation is helpful since it allows people to fuel their creativity, connect with themselves, and as counterintuitive as it may seem, be more productive.

Subsequently, because downtime is necessary for well-being and productivity, it is essential for societal and economic functioning. Therefore, industries need to acknowledge that the mental health of their employees is an asset to their productivity and ensure that their employees have time to unwind. Likewise, social media businesses need to learn that because their users’ mental health and ability to be consumers are interconnected, it is in their best interest to make sure their applications do not lead to destructive mindsets. These shifts in attitudes and structural policies will take long-term collective efforts. However, while we work towards them, there are things we can do in the present to challenge the productivity-centric culture. After all, many of us are in a unique position to embrace newfound free time and, in the process of doing so, lessen the damage of a global pandemic for those who cannot afford to slow down.

Therefore, as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it is important to remember that having less to do is a sign of privilege. After all, numerous people still cannot afford downtime, and those who can often only do so at the cost of their career and income. Still, those of us that can afford free time view it negatively due to decades of messaging and a culture that encourages constant activity. Unsurprisingly, many people feel strongly about free time, with some upset they have too much of it and others craving for more. Either way, the situation reveals deep-rooted problems in the way society treats the human need to unwind. And right now, one way to address these issues is to slow down, if you can, and encourage others to do the same.
