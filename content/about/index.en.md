### Current Ambition
I am a Psychology student and am passionate about working professionally with adolescents and adults, I also have a deep interest in the development and wellbeing of adolescents. Along with this, I also love other fields within psychology such as  Social Psychology, Biopsychology and Forensic Psychology, thereby you will see a lot of posts pertaining to these topics.

As a nature lover and a psychology student, I also have a minor obsession in Space Psychology, which is the application of psychology within spaceflight. I understand this may be a niche field within I/O Psychology and Human Factors and isn't widely researched, but I think it would be interesting to address the issues faced by astronauts and how loneliness, reduced material comforts and so much more can impact the mental wellbeing. Thereby, I hope to keep this a short fun series.

### For More
If you're interested in more of my work do check out [Get Psyched Podcast](https://getpsyched.buzzsprout.com/1333201) where I along with my team discuss about psychology. We have a wide range of series- some of which involve the forensic psychology series and the neuropsychology series. I mainly host the Clinical and Applied Psychology series in a Case Studies format.

[One of my favourite episodes](https://getpsyched.buzzsprout.com/1333201/7937410-case-study-dissociative-identity-disorder-memory-consciousness-blindness-and-sight-across-different-identities) was debunking the case of a middle-aged German woman, B.T. who was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Though she was blind, some of her alter-personalities were capable of sight and could see whilst others suffered from vision loss. This was just one of those episodes that had a beautiful blend of Clinical Psychology and Biopsychology.
